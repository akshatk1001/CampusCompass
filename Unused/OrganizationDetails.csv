The club was founded in 1947, making the Cal Poly Amateur Radio Club the oldest club on campus.</p>\r\n<p><a href=""https://youtu.be/aYUrh_qfUBk"">https://youtu.be/aYUrh_qfUBk</a></p>\r\n<p>Our club station, W6BHZ, is equipped with high-frequency radio transceivers capable of worldwide communications. The station also acts as a San Luis Obispo County Emergency Communications Center, as it is fully equipped with emergency power and radio equipment to support various public safety agencies in the event of a disaster. The club trains routinely with local agencies in mock-disaster situations and has provided emergency communications during the Highway 41 Fire, the Loma Prieta earthquake, and other disasters both local and statewide. The club also supports other, non-emergency events such as bicycle races, triathlons, and parades. Club radio operators maintain communications both for event logistics and medical emergencies.</p>\r\n<p>-</p>\r\n<p>The club maintains a repeater system to extend the range of handheld radios for club members and other licensed amateur radio operators in the San Luis Obispo area. The club also has a number of ways to connect to our local repeater through internet linking such as through EchoLink or All Star Network. The club is also working on constantly developing new projects with students from different majors in the club so that they can apply the concepts taught in class with the Cal Poly ""Learn By Doing"" philosophy. The club continues to move into the future with expanded Internet connectivity, digital radio projects, and additional wide-area-linked radio systems.</p>\r\n<p>-</p>\r\n<p>Amateur radio is a hobby that attracts a wide range of people interested in all facets of radio communications. Involvement in amateur radio allows people to practice their public speaking skills as well as the advancement of one&rsquo;s knowledge of radio theory, electronics, and emergency management. The Cal Poly philosophy is &ldquo;Learn by Doing,&rdquo; and involvement in the Cal Poly Amateur Radio Club embraces this philosophy to its fullest.</p>\r\n<p>-</p>\r\n<p>The Cal Poly Amateur Radio Club strives to create a welcoming environment where everyone can feel accepted and respected as an individual. As an organization, we choose to support and embrace diversity and inclusion within the club as well as within the amateur radio community as a whole. Amateur radio is to be enjoyed by everyone, and discrimination based on race, religion, gender, gender expression, age, disability, or sexual orientation will not be tolerated.</p>\r\n<p>-</p>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re curious, we&rsquo;d love it if you would attend one of our virtual bi-weekly&nbsp;<a href=""http://w6bhz.org/meetings"">meetings</a>&nbsp;or stop by <a href=""https://www.w6bhz.org/the-shack/"">The Shack</a>&nbsp;or <a href=""https://discord.gg/WCuFPss""> our Discord Server</a>&nbsp;to say hello.

Outside of tryouts, alternate tryouts, and extenuating circumstances, there will be no other opportunities to join the competitive team. Players on the competitive team will pay $200 in dues for the year up-front or $80 per quarter.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Competitive team tryouts</strong> will be held on <strong>October 5th and 6th</strong> at the Cal Poly Tennis Courts.
