/**
 * ResultsPage Component
 * 
 * What this page does:
 * - Shows the top 10 clubs that best match the user's quiz answers
 * - Displays each club with a "match score" (like 85% match)
 * - Provides links to learn more about each club
 * - Offers options to retake the quiz or browse all clubs
 * - Only shows if the user completed the entire quiz flow
 * 
 * How we got here:
 * 1. User selected categories on HomePage
 * 2. User answered quiz questions on QuizPage
 * 3. User optionally answered identity questions on IdentityPage
 * 4. Complex algorithm calculated which clubs match their preferences
 * 5. Now we show the results!
 * 
 * What the "match scores" mean:
 * - Each club has characteristics (like "teamwork-focused", "competitive", "creative")
 * - We compared the user's preferences to each club's characteristics
 * - Higher percentage = better match for their interests
 * - 90%+ = excellent match, 70%+ = good match, 50%+ = okay match
 * 
 * @returns {JSX.Element} The rendered ResultsPage component (JSX is like HTML but in JavaScript)
